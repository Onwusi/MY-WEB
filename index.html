            <h3>FROM THE SLUMS TO STRENGTH</h3>
               <p>Born and raised in the heart of Nigeria’s slums, I come from a place where 
                  opportunity is scarce but dreams are limitless. Against the odds, I’ve carved 
                  a path forward—driven by resilience, faith, and an unshakable belief in a better future.
                  Every challenge I’ve faced has shaped my hunger to grow, to build, and to inspire.
                  I carry the grit of where I’m from,
                  not as a burden—but as proof that greatness can rise from anywhere.
